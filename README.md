# Learning-Raylib

I wanted to familiarize myself with using importing and utilizing libraries in C++
I also wanted to explore some simple game dev concepts using a straightforward game dev library.

Utilizing Raylib I was able to create a movable "Character" that could shoot moving projectiles based on key-press.
